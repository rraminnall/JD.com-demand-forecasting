# JD.com demand forecasting
This project is based on the MSOM Data Driven Research Challenge for JD.com, Chinaâ€™s one of the largest retailers alongside Alibaba with over 2.5 million customers. I am finding the most efficient model among traditional and advanced machine learning models to implement demand forecasting for this retailer. As a result, they can improve their performance in managing inventory, pricing and offering promotions. I have added descriptive statistics and some models including time-series ones to compare their prediction accuracy.
